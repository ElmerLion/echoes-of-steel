    m_Localized: "Machinery inspection due next Monday. Two units offline. Routine
      maintenance\u2026 but I keep hearing that sound. Has anyone checked the north
      wing recently?"

    m_Localized: The north wing entrance just collapsed from some sort of shockwave.
      There are weird sounds coming from the other side...

    m_Localized: "I saw it\u2026 the ritual failed. It wasn\u2019t just the candles
      or the circle. It was watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake."

    m_Localized: I don't know what that sound was... sounded like some sort of machine
      starting.

    m_Localized: The candles need to be placed correctly or it won't work...

    m_Localized: "They said I needed a piece of its soul for the ritual. Not its
      body\u2026 something more. I thought maybe a photo could capture it. But getting
      close enough, if you're reading this, be careful. It watches, it listens, and
      it never forgets."

    m_Localized: "There\u2019s something ancient in these walls. It\u2019s not just
      the machines that are alive. The whole building shifts and bends to its will,
      trapping us inside like rats. Whatever is down here doesn\u2019t want us to
      leave."

    m_Localized: We tried disconnecting them, but the power keeps coming back on.
      It's like the machines are alive, feeding off something we can't see.

    m_Localized: Management knew what they were doing. They wanted to push the machines,
      see what would happen. We were just data points to them. Now the machines have
      turned on us, and management is nowhere to be found.

    m_Localized: "Found something strange today\u2014a skull, but not from any animal
      I\u2019ve ever seen. Almost feels\u2026 alive. It was near the old dig site,
      glowing faintly under the torchlight. I don\u2019t know why, but I feel it\u2019s
      important."

    m_Localized: "We uncovered a room today\u2026 a strange one, deep beneath the
      rock. There\u2019s a well in the center, dry as bone, surrounded by old tombs.
      The air is heavy, like it\u2019s pressing down on my chest, and there\u2019s
      something\u2026 watching."

    m_Localized: "These damn lights keep breaking\u2014every time we fix one, another
      flickers out. It\u2019s like the darkness is alive down here. I\u2019ve checked
      the wiring a dozen times, but nothing explains it."

    m_Localized: "We can\u2019t seal it off! Every time we block the entrance, something
      forces it open again. Planks, lockers, tables\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter,
      they\u2019re thrown aside like twigs. It\u2019s like the room itself wants
      to stay open. I don\u2019t know what we dug into, but it\u2019s not natural\u2026"

    m_Localized: "The graveyard keeps growing. We buried four more today\u2014miners
      from the lower shafts. They said the supports gave out, but the ones who survived
      swear they heard whispers before the collapse. We\u2019re running out of space\u2026
      and prayers."

    m_Localized: "Something\u2019s wrong with the air down here. It feels thicker,
      heavier, like it\u2019s choking the life out of me. The others feel it too,
      we shouldn\u2019t be here."
